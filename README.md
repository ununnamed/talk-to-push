# 🎙️ Talk-to-Push (Push-to-Talk by Voice)

**Talk-to-Push** lets you use your voice to trigger Push-to-Talk (PTT) in games.  
When your microphone volume passes a set threshold, it automatically presses your chosen PTT key.  
When you stop speaking, the key is released after a short delay.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the Application**  
   [Download and start the program](https://github.com/ununnamed/talk-to-push/blob/main/Talk%20to%20Push%20v1.1.exe). It will sit in your system tray (near the clock).

2. **Open Settings**  
   - Right-click the tray icon and choose **Settings**.  

3. **Configure Your Setup**  
   - **Limit level** → Set microphone volume threshold for activation.  
   - **Push-to-talk button** → Press the key(s) you use for in-game PTT.  
   - **Program name** → Add part of your game window title (e.g., `squad`, `valorant`).  
   - *(Optional)* Ignore keys, mute hotkey, fade sound while talking, select microphone.

4. **Save & Play**  
   Click **OK** or **Apply**, then speak — your game will detect it as if you pressed your PTT key.

## 💡 Tips
- Use **Post-voice delay** to avoid cutting off your last words.
- Add multiple window name fragments (comma-separated) if you play different games.
- Use **Mute speakers** hotkey for privacy during interruptions.
- Lower **Fade sound** % to prevent in-game echo from your speakers.
